      <h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you

      <h2>2. Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        We use first and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
        technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential"

        cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent
        Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
        cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.

      <p>
        If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some
        functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web
